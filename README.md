      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive substance in the world, and teenagers are consuming it at increasing rates through coffee, energy drinks, soda, and tea. But how does this affect their developing cardiovascular systems? This project set out to explore that essential question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our investigation focused on the immediate effects of caffeine on teenage heart rate and blood pressure. The study was built on curiosity, scientific rigor, and a desire to promote honest conversations around health, habits, and long-term wellness in youth culture.
      </p>

    <section id="method">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        We conducted an observational study involving 15 teen participants (aged 15–17). Each participant:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recorded their baseline heart rate and blood pressure</li>
        <li>Consumed a known amount of caffeine</li>
        <li>Recorded their heart rate and blood pressure again after 30–60 minutes</li>
        <li>Noted how they felt after caffeine intake</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The caffeine sources varied (coffee, energy drinks, soda, and iced tea), and all caffeine values were verified from product labels. We ensured ethical guidelines were followed: no participants with heart conditions, and all data was collected with consent and confidentiality.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="data">
      <h2>Data & Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        We observed a strong trend: higher caffeine doses were linked to greater increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Key Observations:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Energy drinks (80–160 mg caffeine) produced the largest average HR increase: +20 bpm</li>
        <li>Coffee (95 mg) resulted in moderate HR changes: +15–18 bpm</li>
        <li>Soda (40 mg) and iced tea (30 mg) had minimal HR changes: ~+6–8 bpm</li>
        <li>Systolic BP increased by 10–18 points in high-dose cases</li>
        <li>Reported symptoms included jitteriness, anxiety, heightened focus, and in two cases, hand tremors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The data confirms that caffeine affects the teenage body in measurable, significant ways, and that dosage and source matter greatly.
      </p>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This study shows a clear link between caffeine intake and elevated heart rate and blood pressure in teens. The more caffeine consumed, the more pronounced the cardiovascular response. What’s important is not just the presence of caffeine, but the amount, the timing, and the individual's tolerance level.
      </p>
      <p>
        For teens, who are still developing biologically and neurologically, even common products like coffee or energy drinks can cause noticeable physiological changes. These changes may be harmless short-term, but they can also indicate hidden risks, especially when compounded by stress, dehydration, or existing health conditions.

    <section id="impact">
      <h2>Societal Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Through this project, I aim to raise awareness about how everyday caffeine consumption impacts teen health. I plan to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create informational flyers for schools and cafés near campus</li>
        <li>Present this research at youth wellness events or science fairs</li>
        <li>Encourage peers to monitor their caffeine habits thoughtfully</li>
        <li>Launch a teen-led awareness campaign through Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This isn’t just a science project — it’s a call to reflect on the role of caffeine in our culture and our bodies. I believe the work can grow, expand into policy recommendations, and spark new health-conscious habits among youth. It starts with data — but it ends with impact.
