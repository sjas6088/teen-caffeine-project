    <h2>Welcome ‚Äì Let‚Äôs Talk About Your Heart</h2>
    <p>Most people don‚Äôt think twice about caffeine ‚Äì it‚Äôs in coffee, tea, sodas, energy drinks. But when you‚Äôre a teenager, your body is still developing, and how caffeine affects your heart might surprise you.</p>
    <p>I'm Jasnoor, and I'm passionate about science and medicine. I designed this project to explore how caffeine really affects teenage heart rate and blood pressure. What I found was both fascinating and important.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="what">
    <h2>What Is Caffeine, Really?</h2>
    <p>Caffeine is a stimulant ‚Äì that means it speeds things up in your body. It blocks a chemical in your brain that makes you feel tired, which is why you feel more awake. But it also tells your heart to beat faster and your blood pressure to go up. In adults, that‚Äôs usually fine in small doses. In teens, it can have stronger effects.</p>
    <div class="info-box">
      üí° <strong>Did You Know?</strong> A typical energy drink can contain as much caffeine as 2-3 cups of coffee.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="why">
    <h2>Why Does Teen Health Matter Here?</h2>
    <p>Teenagers often turn to caffeine during exams, early school mornings, or late-night gaming sessions. But most don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs affecting their cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels). Understanding this isn‚Äôt just for scientists ‚Äì it‚Äôs for anyone who wants to feel better, sleep better, and protect their long-term health.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="study">
    <h2>My Observational Study</h2>
    <p>I asked 15 teens (aged 15‚Äì17) to take part in a study. Each recorded their heart rate and blood pressure before and after consuming a drink with caffeine. We waited 30‚Äì60 minutes, then compared the results and asked how they felt. The goal was to understand the short-term physical effects of caffeine.</p>

  <section id="data">
    <h2>What the Data Looked Like</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Name</th><th>Age</th><th>Gender</th><th>Source</th><th>mg</th><th>HR Before</th><th>BP Before</th><th>HR After</th><th>BP After</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
      </thead>

        <tr><td>Maya</td><td>16</td><td>F</td><td>Coffee</td><td>95</td><td>72</td><td>110/70</td><td>88</td><td>126/78</td><td>Felt jittery</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Ansh</td><td>17</td><td>M</td><td>Energy Drink</td><td>160</td><td>70</td><td>111/70</td><td>95</td><td>135/82</td><td>Anxiety spike</td></tr>

  <section id="analysis">
    <h2>What Did This Study Show?</h2>
    <p>The results were clear: caffeine raised heart rate and blood pressure in nearly every participant. The more caffeine consumed, the bigger the change. Those who had energy drinks showed the biggest spikes, especially in heart rate.</p>
    <div class="info-box">
      ‚úÖ Teens who drank 160 mg of caffeine had heart rate jumps up to 25 bpm and blood pressure increases of 15‚Äì20 points.
    </div>
    <p>This shows caffeine isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúenergy‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs a chemical that has real, fast effects on the body. For teens, especially those with low sleep, high stress, or existing health issues, these effects could be risky.</p>

      <li><strong>MDPI Journal:</strong> Energy drinks elevate cardiovascular markers in adolescents</li>
      <li><strong>Harvard Health:</strong> Detailed how caffeine works at a molecular level</li>

  <section id="mentor">
    <h2>Who Helped Me?</h2>
    <p>My mentor, Ms. Mahnaz Sabouri, supported me with scientific structure, time management, and moral support. She encouraged me to think like a doctor and present like an educator. I learned how to break down complex science into meaningful stories.</p>
