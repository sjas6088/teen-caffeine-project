    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Many teenagers drink caffeine every day â€” in coffee, energy drinks, soda, or tea â€” but do we really understand what it does to our bodies, especially our hearts? This project was created to answer one simple but powerful question:
    </p>
    <div class="info-box">
      <strong>Essential Question:</strong><br />
      <em>How does caffeine affect heart rate and blood pressure in teenagers, and what can this tell us about our health?</em>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="caffeine">
    <h2>What Is Caffeine?</h2>
    <p>
      Caffeine is a natural stimulant found in plants such as coffee beans, tea leaves, and cacao pods. It is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance worldwide. When consumed, caffeine blocks the effects of adenosine, a brain chemical that promotes sleep and relaxation, which results in increased alertness and wakefulness. However, this stimulant effect also causes the heart to beat faster and blood vessels to constrict, leading to increases in heart rate and blood pressure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="heart">
    <h2>How the Heart Works (In Simple Terms)</h2>
    <p>
      The heart is a muscular organ responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. It beats rhythmically to push oxygen-rich blood through arteries and bring back oxygen-poor blood via veins. Heart rate (HR) is the number of times the heart beats per minute. Blood pressure (BP) is the force exerted by blood against artery walls; it has two numbers: systolic (pressure when the heart beats) and diastolic (pressure when the heart rests).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="why">
    <h2>Why This Research Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Teenagers often consume caffeine to stay awake and improve focus, but the effects of caffeine on their developing cardiovascular systems are not fully understood. Since the teenage years are a critical time for growth, understanding how caffeine affects heart function can help teens make informed choices and avoid potential health risks.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="method">
    <h2>How I Did the Study</h2>
    <p>
      I recruited 15 teenage volunteers aged 15 to 17. Each participant measured their resting heart rate and blood pressure before consuming a known amount of caffeine from sources like coffee, energy drinks, or iced tea. After consuming caffeine, participants waited 30 to 60 minutes before recording their heart rate and blood pressure again. The volunteers also noted any physical or emotional sensations like jitteriness or anxiety. I compiled the data and analyzed it for patterns.
    </p>
    <div class="info-box">
      Tools used: Digital heart rate and blood pressure monitors, consent forms, observation journals, and spreadsheet software (Google Sheets) for data tracking and visualization.
    </div>

  <section id="analysis">
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>
      Most participants experienced an increase in heart rate by approximately 10 to 25 beats per minute after caffeine consumption. The increase was more pronounced in those who consumed higher caffeine doses, such as energy drinks. Systolic blood pressure increased by 10-20 mmHg, while diastolic pressure rose slightly. Subjective effects such as jitteriness and anxiety correlated with higher caffeine intake.
    </p>
    <div class="info-box">
      ðŸ’¡ <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Caffeine causes measurable short-term increases in heart rate and blood pressure in teenagers, with stronger doses producing greater effects. These changes could affect cardiovascular health if caffeine is consumed excessively or regularly.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="literature">
    <h2>Research & Literature Review</h2>
    <p>
      To understand how my results compare with established knowledge, I reviewed scientific articles and reputable sources on caffeineâ€™s cardiovascular effects in teenagers and adults.
    </p>

    <h3>Scientific Articles & Studies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>MDPI Journal on Energy Drinks (2019):</strong> A study published in the <em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em> examined the acute effects of energy drinks on young adults. It found that energy drinks caused significant increases in heart rate and blood pressure, sometimes leading to palpitations and anxiety. This supports my findings that higher caffeine doses cause stronger cardiovascular responses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Harvard Health Publishing (2020):</strong> Harvard Medical School explains that caffeine blocks the adenosine receptor, stimulating the central nervous system and causing increased heart rate and blood pressure. It also emphasizes that tolerance varies, and young people may be more sensitive due to lower habitual caffeine intake.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>CBS News Report on ER Visits (2018):</strong> Reports indicate a rise in emergency room visits for chest pain and heart palpitations among teenagers linked to excessive energy drink consumption. This raises public health concerns about caffeine overdosing in youths.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Journal of Psychosomatic Research (2016):</strong> Long-term caffeine intake can contribute to sustained blood pressure elevation, increasing cardiovascular disease risk later in life. While my study focused on short-term effects, these findings highlight the importance of moderation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines (2011):</strong> This paper advises that caffeine intake should be limited in children and adolescents, recommending no more than 100 mg per day to avoid negative health effects, reinforcing the need for education about caffeine limits.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary of Key Scientific Points</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Caffeine increases heart rate (tachycardia)</strong> by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system.</li>
      <li><strong>Blood pressure rises temporarily</strong> after caffeine intake due to vasoconstriction.</li>
      <li><strong>Individual responses vary</strong> based on age, weight, genetics, and tolerance.</li>
      <li><strong>High caffeine doses, especially from energy drinks, pose health risks</strong> such as arrhythmia, anxiety, and hypertension.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-term excessive caffeine consumption can lead to chronic hypertension.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Teenagers should limit caffeine intake to under 100 mg daily</strong> to reduce cardiovascular risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Core Competencies I Developed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thinking:</strong> Designed and conducted a scientific experiment with real data collection and analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Presented complex scientific concepts clearly for peers and adults.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Responsibility:</strong> Ensured ethical treatment of volunteers, including informed consent and privacy.</li>
      <li><strong>Digital Literacy:</strong> Used digital tools for data recording, graphing, and creating a webpage.</li>

  </section>

  <section id="volunteer">
    <h2>Volunteering & Ethics</h2>
    <p>
      All participants were volunteers who signed consent forms after being informed about the studyâ€™s goals and risks. Their health was monitored throughout, and they were encouraged to report any discomfort. Personal data was anonymized to protect privacy. I plan to present these findings at school to raise awareness about caffeine's effects.

  <section id="mentor">
    <h2>Mentor Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      I worked closely with Ms. Mahnaz Sabouri, a science educator with experience in physiology and research methods. She helped me design my experiment, taught me how to analyze data properly, and emphasized the importance of clear communication. Her guidance inspired me to pursue further studies in health science and research.
    </p>

  <section id="impact">
    <h2>Final Reflection & Impact</h2>
    <p>
      This project deepened my understanding of how everyday choices affect our health. Seeing the real effects of caffeine on my peersâ€™ hearts showed me the power of science to inform healthier decisions. I hope this encourages other teens to think critically about what they consume and take care of their hearts for the future.
