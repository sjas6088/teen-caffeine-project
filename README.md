    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Many teenagers drink caffeine every day â€” in coffee, energy drinks, soda, or tea â€” but do we really understand what it does to our bodies, especially our hearts? This project was created to answer one simple but powerful question:
    </p>
    <div class="info-box">
      <strong>Essential Question:</strong><br />
      <em>How does caffeine affect heart rate and blood pressure in teenagers, and what can this tell us about our health?</em>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="caffeine">
    <h2>What Is Caffeine?</h2>
    <p>
      Caffeine is a drug â€” a legal stimulant that affects your brain and nervous system. It makes you feel more alert by blocking a chemical called adenosine that normally helps you feel sleepy. This also causes your heart to beat faster and your blood vessels to tighten, raising your blood pressure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="heart">
    <h2>How the Heart Works (In Simple Terms)</h2>
    <p>
      Your heart is a powerful muscle that pumps blood around your body. Heart rate is how many times it beats per minute. Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against your artery walls. Both can change depending on activity, stress, and â€” as this study shows â€” caffeine.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="why">
    <h2>Why This Research Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Teens often drink caffeine to stay awake, study longer, or boost energy â€” but many donâ€™t know it can affect their growing bodies. Because teens are still developing, they may be more sensitive to caffeineâ€™s effects than adults.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="method">
    <h2>How I Did the Study</h2>
    <p>
      I recruited 15 teens, aged 15â€“17, who recorded their heart rate and blood pressure before and after drinking a caffeine source. Each participant waited 30â€“60 minutes after drinking and reported how they felt. I tracked their results and used data to find patterns.
    </p>
    <div class="info-box">
      Tools used: Digital monitors, observation logs, participant consent forms, and Google Sheets for data analysis.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="data">
    <h2>Data Table</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Name</th><th>Age</th><th>Source</th><th>mg</th><th>HR Before</th><th>BP Before</th><th>HR After</th><th>BP After</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Maya</td><td>16</td><td>Coffee</td><td>95</td><td>72</td><td>110/70</td><td>88</td><td>126/78</td><td>Jittery</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Ansh</td><td>17</td><td>Energy Drink</td><td>160</td><td>70</td><td>111/70</td><td>95</td><td>135/82</td><td>Anxious</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Anaya</td><td>16</td><td>Iced Tea</td><td>30</td><td>76</td><td>108/68</td><td>82</td><td>114/72</td><td>Focused</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Ajit</td><td>17</td><td>Coffee</td><td>95</td><td>66</td><td>109/69</td><td>84</td><td>123/75</td><td>Energized</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </section>

  <section id="analysis">
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>
      Most teens showed a heart rate increase of 10â€“25 beats per minute after drinking caffeine. Those who had stronger drinks like energy drinks showed the biggest changes. Systolic blood pressure (top number) increased in all cases.
    </p>
    <div class="info-box">
      ðŸ’¡ Conclusion: Caffeine causes short-term heart and blood pressure changes in teenagers, and stronger doses mean bigger changes.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="literature">
    <h2>Research & Sources</h2>
    <p>
      I reviewed science articles to compare my findings to professional studies. Hereâ€™s what I learned:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MDPI:</strong> Energy drinks cause rapid heart rate increase in teens.</li>
      <li><strong>Harvard Health:</strong> Caffeine blocks adenosine and increases nervous system activity.</li>
      <li><strong>CBS News:</strong> Reported ER visits for chest pain after caffeine overdose.</li>
      <li><strong>Journal of Psychosomatic Research:</strong> Long-term use can raise BP over time.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="skills">
    <h2>Core Competencies I Developed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thinking:</strong> Designed a real scientific study with real data</li>
      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Explained complex ideas in a clear way</li>
      <li><strong>Social Responsibility:</strong> Ensured safety, consent, and ethical testing</li>
      <li><strong>Digital Literacy:</strong> Used spreadsheets, websites, and design tools</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="volunteer">
    <h2>Volunteering & Ethics</h2>
    <p>
      All volunteers were given consent forms and monitored safely. I explained their role and kept data private. I plan to give a presentation at my school to help others understand caffeine better and make healthier choices.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="mentor">
    <h2>Mentor Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      I worked with Ms. Mahnaz Sabouri, a mentor who guided me through the scientific process and helped me stay organized. Her support reminded me that science is also about people, and communication matters just as much as the data.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="impact">
    <h2>Final Reflection & Impact</h2>
    <p>
      This project helped me see how everyday habits connect to long-term health. I now understand that even small choices, like grabbing a coffee or energy drink, affect our heart in real ways. I hope to inspire my peers to be mindful, informed, and heart-conscious in their daily lives.
