    <h1>Caffeine & The Teenage Heart</h1>
    <p>A capstone project exploring how caffeine affects teens' cardiovascular health</p>

    <h2>Essential Question</h2>
    <p><strong>How does caffeine affect heart rate and blood pressure in teenagers, and what can this reveal about its impact on adolescent health?</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed stimulants in the world — but what does it really do to the teenage heart? As more teens turn to coffee, energy drinks, and caffeinated sodas for energy and focus, understanding its real impact on the body becomes more than just a health curiosity — it becomes a public health necessity.</p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>I recruited 15 teenage volunteers, aged 15–17, who agreed to consume common caffeine sources (coffee, soda, iced tea, or energy drinks). Each participant recorded their resting heart rate and blood pressure before and after consuming a set amount of caffeine. Observations were recorded 30–60 minutes after consumption using validated measuring tools.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Tools Used:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Digital blood pressure monitor</li>
        <li>Observation log spreadsheet</li>
        <li>Survey consent forms</li>
        <li>Time-tracking (digital timer)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>Results showed clear patterns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Energy drinks (80–160mg)</strong> raised average heart rate by 18–25 bpm</li>
      <li><strong>Coffee (95mg)</strong> caused a 15–18 bpm increase</li>
      <li><strong>Soda and iced tea (30–40mg)</strong> caused minimal changes (5–8 bpm)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Blood pressure also rose, especially systolic values, in participants who consumed higher caffeine doses. Reports of jitteriness, increased focus, or anxiety were most common with energy drinks.</p>

    <div class="graph-placeholder">[Insert scatter plot: Caffeine mg vs HR Increase]</div>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>These findings suggest that even moderate doses of caffeine significantly affect teenagers' heart rates and blood pressure. This may be due to smaller body mass, lower tolerance, or ongoing brain development in adolescents. Teens may be more sensitive to caffeine’s cardiovascular effects than adults.</p>

    <p>While caffeine is not inherently dangerous in low to moderate doses, the rising popularity of high-caffeine energy drinks among teens may require more awareness and regulation, especially considering the side effects reported — such as anxiety, dizziness, or racing heartbeats.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project helped me understand the direct and measurable ways caffeine affects teen health. It also made me more passionate about contributing to public awareness. I plan to turn this project into a small local campaign at my school to help students make better informed choices about caffeine — especially before tests or sports events.</p>

    <p>Teen health should be guided by evidence — and this project is one step in that direction.</p>

    <h2>Future Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct a larger study across multiple schools</li>
      <li>Partner with health teachers or school nurses to share findings</li>
      <li>Create a website or app to track safe caffeine intake for teens</li>
    </ul>
